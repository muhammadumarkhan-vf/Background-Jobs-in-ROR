# Background-Jobs-in-ROR

Background jobs are used for executing tasks in which we don't need instant response. E.g Encoding video, generating sitemap, generating product listing feeds, image thumbnail generation etc

Rails provides lot of gems for background job processing but i am sharing these 2 according to my experience on moderate and huge traffic websites
